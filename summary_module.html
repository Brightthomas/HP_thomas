<p><h1>The Internet</h1></p>

<p>The internet is a globally connected network system facilitating worldwide communication and access to data 
resources through a vast collection of private, public, business, academic and government networks. It is governed 
by agencies like the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (or IANA) that establish universal protocols.
The terms internet and World Wide Web are often used interchangeably, but they are not exactly the same thing; 
the internet refers to the global communication system, including hardware and infrastructure, while the web is 
one of the services communicated over the internet.
<p><b>A Brief History of the Internet</b></p>

<b>Sharing Resources</b>

<p>The Internet started in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information. Computers in the 
'60s were large and immobile and in order to make use of information stored in any one computer, one had to 
either travel to the site of the computer or have magnetic computer tapes sent through the conventional postal 
system.

<p><b>TYPES OF INTERNET PROTOCOLS</b></p>

There's more to the Internet than the World Wide Web

When we think of the Internet we often think only of the World Wide Web. The Web is one of several ways to 
retrieve information from the Internet. These different types of Internet connections are known as protocols. You 
could use separate software applications to access the Internet with each of these protocols, though you probably 
wouldn't need to. Many Internet Web browsers allow users to access files using most of the protocols. Following 
are three categories of Internet services and examples of types of services in each category.
<p><b>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</b></p>

This was one of the first Internet services developed and it allows users to move files from one computer to 

another. Using the FTP program, a user can logon to a remote computer, browse through its files, and either 
download or upload files (if the remote computer allows). These can be any type of file, but the user is only allowed 
to see the file name; no description of the file content is included. You might encounter the FTP protocol if you 
try to download any software applications from the World Wide Web. Many sites that offer downloadable 
applications use the FTP protocol.
        
 <p><b>Multimedia Information Protocol

Hypertext transfer protocol — a.k.a. "The Web"</b></p>

The World Wide Web is the new kid on the block having only been developed in the late 1980s by the European 
Lab for Particle Physics in Switzerland. This Internet protocol was quickly embraced by the public and has become 
the most popular way to provide and obtain information from the Internet. The Web offers not only access to files 
to download, but offers a way to jump from site to site through a series of connecting hyperlinks.
The most distinguishing feature of the Web is the way that text is formatted. A series of "tags" is used to encode 
and format text, graphics, animation, sound, and other types of files. These tags are called HTML (HyperText 
Markup Language). These HTML files appear on your computer screen as determined by the tags used in its coding. 
You can see the "source" HTML coding for any Web page by choosing to "View Source" from your browser's menu 
bar.
Most browsers allow for access through FTP, Gopher, telnet, and email as well as through the hypertext transfer 
protocol, although installation of helper applications may be required. These are programs that work with the 
browser and allow access to a variety of protocols and file types.
<p><b>Ethernet versus Internet: 4 Factors</p></b>

The Internet is a general term for computer networks, and Ethernet is a part of the Internet. Both are regarded as 

the network used to connect to the computer, but the scope is different.
<p><b>1. Connection method</b></p>
The Internet connection via ethernet is carried out as follows: a cable (coaxial cables or special twisted pairs) is 
connected from the provider’s station to your PC, router, or modem, inserted into a specifically designated
connector, and a certain configuration of the computer’s network card is performed. On the other hand, the 
Internet establishes a wireless connection.
<p><b>2. Network type</b></p>
The Internet is a Wide Area Network (collection of many LANs), that spreads a big geographic area. Ethernet is a 
Local Area Network (LAN), that spread +a small geographic area.
<p><b>Key Differences Internet vs Ethernet</b></p>

1. Ethernet connects nearby equipment and can have hundreds of Ethernets within a local area distance. 

The corresponding ones are token ring,, ATM, WLAN FDDI, Etc. LAN. Ethernet specifies the network 
topology, access control method, transmission rate, etc. of the local area network.
<p>2. The Internet is the global Internet including local area networks. It uses the TCP/IP protocol cluster as the 
communication method, and the system structure is divided into 4 layers: application layer, transport 
<b>layer, network layer, and network interface layer.</b> Private, public, academic, commercial, or government 
networks can all be connected to each other through the Internet.
<p>3. Generally speaking, Ethernet is a small network that works at the network interface layer, while the 
Internet is a large network that connects various small networks (i.e collection of multiple LAN).
<p><b>WORKING PRINCIPLE OF THE INTERNET AND HOW DEVICES COMMUNICATE</b></p>
The internet is a worldwide computer network that transmits a variety of data and media across interconnected 
devices. It works by using a packet routing network that follows Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control 
Protocol (TCP).
TCP and IP work together to ensure that data transmission across the internet is consistent and reliable, no matter 
which device you’re using or where you’re using it.
When data is transferred over the internet, it’s delivered in messages and packets. Data sent over the internet is 
called a message, but before messages get sent, they’re broken up into tinier parts called packets.
These messages and packets travel from one source to the next using Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control 
Protocol (TCP). IP is a system of rules that govern how information is sent from one computer to another computer 
over an internet connection.
